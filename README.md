# E-Commerce Live Chat (Angular)

This is a minimal **Angular** app designed to simulate the customer side of a **live chat system**. Customers can open the chat interface and communicate in real-time with available support agents using **Socket.IO**.

This app is **integrated with the full customer support backend** and is fully dynamic — you don't need to register the customer beforehand.

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Production App:** https://ecommerce-chat-angular.vercel.app/
- **Backend API:** https://customer-support-node.dinamo-app.com/

---

## 💬 Features

- 🔐 Chat initiated without login (anonymous or via user ID)
- 💬 Real-time messaging via Socket.IO
- 📶 Typing indicator for customers and agents
- 🚀 Automatically assigns to an available agent
- 🧠 Smart behavior: If agents are busy/away, the chat is queued

---

## 🔗 Real-time Flow

Once a customer opens the chat and sends a message:

1. The backend checks for available agents.
2. If one is available, the chat is assigned instantly.
3. If no agents are available, chat is marked as **new** and queued.
4. Customer gets notified when agent responds.

3. Update `src/environments/environment.ts` for development:
